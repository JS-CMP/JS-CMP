# Security Policy

## Introduction

The security of JS-CMP is paramount to ensure that the software remains secure, robust, and reliable. This document outlines the security considerations, practices, and procedures adopted in the development and maintenance of JS-CMP. The guidelines described are essential for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of applications transpiled and executed using JS-CMP.

## Security Objectives

1. **Protect Transpiled Code**: Ensure that the transpiled C++ code maintains the same security standards expected in JavaScript.
2. **Prevent Injection Attacks**: Guard against code injection, both at the transpilation level and during runtime.
3. **Secure Data Handling**: Safeguard against data leaks and ensure secure handling and transmission of data.
4. **Access Control**: Maintain proper access control mechanisms within the transpiler to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
5. **Update and Patch Management**: Ensure a robust process for managing security updates and patches.

## Security Practices

### Code Security

- **Static Code Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to detect vulnerabilities in C++ code, such as buffer overflows, memory leaks, and unsafe constructions.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct thorough code reviews with a focus on security, ensuring that code changes adhere to best security practices.
- **Secure Coding Guidelines**: Follow established secure coding guidelines to avoid common vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

### Dependency Management

- **Third-Party Libraries**: Regularly update and review third-party libraries (e.g., Boost) for known vulnerabilities. Use tools to monitor and alert the team about any security risks in dependencies.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Limit the use of external libraries to those that are essential, reducing potential attack surfaces.

## Community Participation

- **Security Issue Reporting**: Encourage the community to report security vulnerabilities via a dedicated security contact or issue template on the project's repository.
- **Disclosure Guidelines**: Follow responsible disclosure practices to notify affected parties and the community of security issues.

## Conclusion

Security is a critical aspect of the design and operation of JS-CMP. By adhering to these security practices and fostering a security-conscious development culture, the JS-CMP project aims to deliver secure and reliable software to its users. This Security.md document should be periodically reviewed and updated to adapt to new security threats and best practices.
