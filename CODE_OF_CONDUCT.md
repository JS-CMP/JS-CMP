# Quality Assurance Plan for JS-CMP

## Project Overview

JS-CMP is a transpiler that converts JavaScript (ECMAScript 5) code into C++ code and compiles it into a binary. The goal is to allow JavaScript developers to leverage the performance benefits of C++ for backend applications. The project is written in C++ and uses Boost libraries for dependencies.

**Primary Platforms**: Linux (primary), macOS (secondary), Windows (future expansion)

---

## Quality Assurance Objectives

1. **Ensure Functional Accuracy**: Validate that the transpiler faithfully reproduces JavaScript functionality.
2. **Support ECMAScript 5 Features**: Ensure all ECMAScript 5 features are covered.
3. **Guarantee Express.js Support**: Ensure compatibility with the Express.js framework for backend development.
4. **Establish Cross-Platform Consistency**: Primarily target Linux and macOS but consider future Windows compatibility.
5. **Track Performance Improvements**: Compare performance against Node.js to ensure competitive execution times.
6. **Maintain Documentation Quality**: Keep project documentation accurate and up-to-date for ease of use.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Functional Testing
- **Testing Framework**: We will use a suite of tests that checks ECMAScript 5 compliance.
- **Lexer-Specific Tests**: Additional regression tests for the lexer are stored in a separate repository.
- **Automated Test Runs**: CI/CD pipelines run all tests for every pull request to ensure continuous functional accuracy.

### 2. Performance Testing
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Once functionality is complete, JS-CMP performance will be evaluated against Node.js. Execution times will be tracked for representative workloads.
- **Profiling Tools**: In cases where JS-CMP lags behind Node.js, profiling tools will be used to identify and optimize bottlenecks.

### 3. Compatibility Testing
- **Linux and macOS**: CI/CD currently includes build checks for both Linux and macOS. Windows support is not a current priority, but platform-specific tests and compatibility checks will be added if support expands in the future.
- **Cross-Platform Output**: Ensure that transpiled code behaves consistently on Linux and macOS by verifying key functionality on both platforms.

## CI/CD Integration

1. **Automated Testing**: All tests run on each pull request to catch issues early.
2. **Code Formatting**: We use a tool to ensure consistent code style across the codebase.
3. **Code Analysis**: Static analysis tools are used to catch potential issues before they become problems, to maintain code quality and consistency.
4. **Pull Request Review**: Every pull request is reviewed by at least two team members for functionality, documentation, and code quality.
5. **Continuous Documentation Build**: Documentation is built and deployed automatically with each commit to ensure it stays up-to-date.

## Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Reporting**: Both the lexer and C++ compiler (g++/clang) emit errors as needed. Key error types include:
  - **Syntax Errors**: Lexer errors for invalid JavaScript syntax.
  - **Compilation Errors**: g++ or clang will log compilation errors.

---

## Documentation and Usability

- **Documentation Review**: Documentation is reviewed with each pull request. Any undocumented functions or features will be flagged for updates.
- **Future Binary Distribution**: To streamline setup, precompiled binaries for supported platforms (Linux/macOS) will be released and made available via package managers.
- **Documentation Accessibility**: Documentation will be available online and offline, with a focus on ease of use and clarity.
- **Documentation Structure**: The documentation will be organized into sections for installation, usage, API reference like functions and classes.
---

## Community Feedback Integration

- **Issue Reporting and Templates**: Guidelines for issue reporting will be provided, including templates for bug reports and feature requests.
- **Community Contributions**: Contributions will be encouraged through clear contribution guidelines and a welcoming environment.

---

## Maintenance and Continuous Improvement

- **Regular Performance Checks**: Benchmarking and profiling will be done periodically to monitor and improve performance over time.
- **Documentation Accuracy**: The documentation will be updated with every relevant change, ensuring users have access to the latest information.
- **Platform Expansion Consideration**: If platform support expands, new tests will be added for compatibility and functionality on additional platforms.

## Summary

This QA plan establishes a robust framework for testing, performance evaluation, error handling, documentation, and community engagement. With automated tests, CI/CD integration, and continuous performance monitoring, JS-CMP aims to provide a reliable, high-performance transpiler that leverages the strengths of both JavaScript and C++ for backend applications.
