## Quality Assurance Plan for JS-CMP

### Project Overview

JS-CMP is a transpiler that converts JavaScript (ECMAScript 5) code into C++ code and compiles it into a binary. The goal is to allow JavaScript developers to leverage the performance benefits of C++ for backend applications. The project is written in C++ and uses Boost libraries for dependencies.

**Primary Platforms**: Linux (primary), macOS (secondary), Windows (future expansion)

---

## Quality Assurance Objectives

1. **Ensure Functional Accuracy**: Validate that the transpiler faithfully reproduces JavaScript functionality.
2. **Support ECMAScript 5 Features**: Ensure all ECMAScript 5 features are covered.
3. **Guarantee Express.js Support**: Ensure compatibility with the Express.js framework for backend development.
4. **Establish Cross-Platform Consistency**: Primarily target Linux and macOS but consider future Windows compatibility.
5. **Track Performance Improvements**: Compare performance against Node.js to ensure competitive execution times.
6. **Maintain Documentation Quality**: Keep project documentation accurate and up-to-date for ease of use.

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Functional Testing
- **Testing Framework**: Use the [Test262 suite](https://github.com/tc39/test262) to validate ECMAScript 5 compliance.
- **Lexer-Specific Tests**: Maintain separate regression tests for the lexer.
- **Automated Test Runs**: CI/CD pipelines run all tests for every pull request to ensure continuous functional accuracy.
- **Tracking**: Monitor the number of passing tests in Test262 rather than percentage coverage.

### 2. Performance Testing
- **Target**: Achieve faster performance than Node.js.
- **Benchmarking Scenarios**: Use basic workloads simulating high request volumes.
- **Monitoring**: Implement performance checks after each significant feature addition.
- **Profiling Tools**: Use profiling tools to identify and optimize bottlenecks if JS-CMP lags behind Node.js.

### 3. Compatibility Testing
- **Linux and macOS**: CI/CD includes build checks for both Linux and macOS with both GCC and Clang compilers.
- **Express.js Compatibility**: Implement CI/CD pipeline to test compatibility with different versions of Express.js.
- **Cross-Platform Output**: Ensure that transpiled code behaves consistently on Linux and macOS by verifying key functionality on both platforms.

## Code Quality and Review Process

### 1. Code Review Checklist
- **Code Formatting**: Ensure consistent code style across the codebase.
- **Performance Optimization**: Review code for performance improvements.
- **Documentation Completeness**: Ensure all code is well-documented.
- **Build Success**: Verify that the code builds successfully on all target devices.
- **Error Handling**: Check for proper error handling and logging.
- **Security**: Review code for security vulnerabilities.
- **API Consistency**: Ensure consistent API design and usage.
- **Zero Warnings**: Eliminate all compiler warnings.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure that the code passes all automated tests.
- 
### 2. Branching Strategy
- **Feature Branches**: Use branches like 'features', 'fix', 'wip'.
- **Branch Naming Convention**: Follow kebab-case for branch names.

---

## Release Management

### 1. Release Frequency
- **Monthly Releases**: Aim for monthly releases to incorporate new features and fixes.
- **Hotfixes**: Implement a rapid response process for critical issues.
- **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases.
- **Tags**: Tag each release in the repository.

### 2. Changelog
- **Maintain Changelog**: Keep a detailed changelog for each release.
- **Release Notes**: Include detailed release notes for each version.

## Security Considerations

### 1. Vulnerability Management
- **Guidelines**: Follow guidelines outlined in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

---

## Documentation and Usability

### 1. Documentation Review
- **Pull Request Review**: Review documentation in every pull request.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure clear and accessible documentation for varying skill levels.
- **Documentation Structure**: Organize documentation into sections for installation, usage, API reference, functions, and classes.

### 2. Future Binary Distribution
- **Precompiled Binaries**: Release precompiled binaries for supported platforms (Linux/macOS) via package managers.

---

## Community Engagement and Continuous Improvement

### 1. Feedback Integration
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Utilize [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), issue templates, and pull request templates.
- **Community Feedback**: Review community feedback during weekly team meetings.

### 2. Team Knowledge Sharing
- **Weekly Meetings**: Discuss new ECMAScript specifications and C++ best practices.

---

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

### 1. Automated Testing
- **Test262 Suite**: Run the Test262 suite on each pull request.
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Use matrix CI/CD for Linux, macOS, GCC, and Clang.
- **Documentation Checks**: Include documentation checks in CI/CD pipelines.
- **Documentation Deployment**: Deploy documentation to a static site on each successful build.

---

## Quality Metrics and Reporting

### 1. Test Passing Rate
- **Tracking**: Monitor and report the number of passing Test262 tests.
- **Trend Analysis**: Track the trend of passing tests over time.

### 2. Performance Benchmarks
- **Comparison**: Compare execution times against Node.js for defined workloads.

---

## Continuous Improvement

### 1. Regular Reviews
- **Monthly Reviews**: Conduct monthly reviews of QA processes and metrics.

### 2. Feedback Loop
- **Incorporate Learnings**: Integrate learnings from each release into the QA process.

## Summary

This QA plan establishes a robust framework for testing, performance evaluation, error handling, documentation, and community engagement. With automated tests, CI/CD integration, and continuous performance monitoring, JS-CMP aims to provide a reliable, high-performance transpiler that leverages the strengths of both JavaScript and C++ for backend applications.
